# What are mental models, and why it is important ?

You can think of mental models is a simulator in your head on how a specific thing works.

Why is it important ?

One word: __Predictions__

It give you the ultimate power. Knowing and predicting the future. 

It also give you a framework of assimilating framented informations.



# What are Lattice Work of mental models ?


The term Lattice work of Mental Models is widely known from Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire-Hathaway, in [a speech to USC graduate](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html) on 1994.


## How to create and use a lattice work of mental models ?

How did Charlie Munger built his lattice work of mental models ?

In the book Damn Right!: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger, Munger talks about the fundamentals of organizing etho:

>* you must both rank and use disciplines in order of fundamentalness
>* you must, like it or not, master to tested fluency and routinely use the truly essential parts of all four constituents of the fundamental four-discipline combination, whith particulartly intense attension given to disciplines more fundamental than your own, focus one first and test it to fluency:
>* you may never practice either crossdisciplinary absorption without attribution or departure from a "principle of economy" that forbids explanining in any other way anything readily explainable from more dundamental material in your own or any other discipline.
>* But when the step four  approach doesn't produce much new and useful insight, you should hypothesize, and test to establishement, new principle ordinarily by using methods similar to those that created successful old principles, But you may not use any new principle, inconsistent with an old one, unless you can now prove that the old principle is not true.

And Three other principles on how to use the mental models:

>* the first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.
>* you must able to convolute these models in your head!
>* you must use attribution to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on the allticework of of models .

In Layman's term, If you want to build and use a lattice work of mental models, you need to do the following:

* Collect and create A checklist of mental models, and how could you use it
* Memorize the list( by using Anki or other flash card tools)
* Pratice using the mental lattice by using examples and simuations(with predefinited answer), and connect your daily experience (both direct or indirect) to your lattice.

It definitely not easy , but it seems doable and I will try to follow this methodology to replicate what Charli Munger had done.

The good thing is, Charlie Munger mentions there are only roughtly 100 mental models in his lattice work of mental models,  and he mentioned some of them already. 

There are already couple of very good blogs talks about various mental models, and couple of good books also. But I find it difficult to use these mental models, for two reasons:

* Not enough examples. Human learn best when saw an example. Me too
* Don't have a trigger. Standalone mental model is useless. You need a trigger( as input) so you can apply the mental models.

The best and probably the fastest way to learn something is to teach it, I figured I could learn mental model faster by try to teaching it, and hope you can find some bits useful along the way.
