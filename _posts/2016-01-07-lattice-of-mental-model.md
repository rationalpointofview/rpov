You can think of mental models is a simulator in your head on how a specific thing works.

Why is it important ?

Twos words: __Predictions__ and __Simplicity__

* It gives you the ultimate power. Knowing and predicting the __future__. 

* It gives you a framework of __assimilating__ fragmented informations, which is a must in this digital age.

* It also __cut off the bloat__ and expose whats essential, thus simplified the thinking.

**Example**:

What is the most famous and impactful mental model in human history? 

It could well be [Newton's three laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion).

Lets say your head is often hit by apples while sitting under an apple tree:

before you know the newton's three laws of motion, a smart reader like you will develop a feeling your pain is sort of propotional to the size of the apple.

But after you knows the Newtons law:

* you can predict how fast the apple falls, and how much is the impacting force on your head

* the other guy reports he got hit by a pearl while sitting under an pearl tree, you can attribute this to newtons law too.

* it cut away the irrelevent information, you know the only thing matters is the mass of the apple and how high it is. The color,size of the apple and thousand other variables doesn't matter, you can safely cut it off.






# What are Lattice Work of mental models ?


The term Lattice work of Mental Models is widely known from Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire-Hathaway, in [a speech to USC graduate](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html) on 1994.


## How to create and use a lattice work of mental models ?

How did Charlie Munger built his lattice work of mental models ?

In the book Damn Right!: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger, Munger talks about the fundamentals of organizing etho:

>* you must both rank and use disciplines in order of fundamentalness
>* you must, like it or not, master to tested fluency and routinely use the truly essential parts of all four constituents of the fundamental four-discipline combination, whith particulartly intense attension given to disciplines more fundamental than your own, focus one first and test it to fluency:
>* you may never practice either crossdisciplinary absorption without attribution or departure from a "principle of economy" that forbids explanining in any other way anything readily explainable from more dundamental material in your own or any other discipline.
>* But when the step four  approach doesn't produce much new and useful insight, you should hypothesize, and test to establishement, new principle ordinarily by using methods similar to those that created successful old principles, But you may not use any new principle, inconsistent with an old one, unless you can now prove that the old principle is not true.

And Three other principles on how to use the mental models:

>* the first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.
>* you must able to convolute these models in your head!
>* you must use attribution to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on the allticework of of models .

In Layman's term, If you want to build and use a lattice work of mental models, you need to do the following:

* Collect and create A checklist of mental models, and how could you use it
* Memorize the list( by using Anki or other flash card tools)
* Pratice using the mental lattice by using examples and simuations(with predefinited answer), and connect your daily experience (both direct or indirect) to your lattice.

It definitely not easy , but it seems doable and I will try to follow this methodology to replicate what Charli Munger had done.

The good thing is, Charlie Munger mentions there are only roughtly 100 mental models in his lattice work of mental models,  and he mentioned some of them already. 

There are already couple of very good blogs talks about various mental models, and couple of good books also. But I find it difficult to use these mental models, for two reasons:

* Not enough examples. Human learn best by example.
* Don't have a trigger. Standalone mental model is useless. You need a trigger( as input) so you can apply the mental models.
* No Attribution, Mental Model should by connected to form a lattice.

The best way to learn something is to teach it, I figured I could learn mental model faster by try to teaching it, and hope you can find some bits useful along the way.


## How to maintain and use these mental models ?

Straigh from Munger:

> 1) His formal education is wide enough to cover practically everything useful in piloting.

>2) His knowledge of practically everything needed by pilots is not taught just well enough to enable him to pass one test or two; instead, all of his knowledge is raised to practice-based fluency, even in handling two or three intertwined hazards at once.

>3) Like any good algebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward fashion and sometimes in reverse; and so he learns when to concentrate mostly on what he wants to happen and also when to concentrate mostly on avoiding what he does not want to happen.

>4) His training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage from his later malfunctions; and so what is most important in his performance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest fluency levels.

>5) “Checklist” routines are always mandatory for him

>6) Even after original training he is forced into a special knowledge-maintenance routine: regular use of the aircraft simulator to prevent atrophy through long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare and important problems.

>The need for this clearly correct six-element system, with its large demands in a narrow-scale field where stakes are high, is rooted in the deep structure of the human mind. Therefore, we must expect that the education we need for broad scale problem-solving will keep all these elements but with awesomely expanded coverage for each element. How could it be otherwise?
