Lattice Rank 1:

The first mental model Charlie Mungers Mentions, is Mathematics, why mathematics is ranked number 1 ? because it give you the ability to predict things, and it is true across the universe. 1 + 1 is always equal to 2.

How should you use this mental Model ? Mathematics is a great way to clear your mind.

__How to use this mental Model__:

* Identify the measurements of results you are trying to achieve;
    eg. for a business it is quite simple, cash flow and profit;

* laydown a spreadsheet, try to predict the scenarios 12 months later.   
 
    For example;

    If you want to start a business and think it will work, create a spreadsheet, laid down some number and your assumptions;

        * calcualte the cash flow scenarios, 
        * calucate the profit level, varies your assumptions and throw some different [Monte Carlo Scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to see how your business hold up.
        * Find out the key ratios of your business. eg rent to revenue ratio , gross margin etc, and scale your business revenue by scaling up or down 10 times, check the number and how it will hold up.  


## Compound Interest:

>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.”
>Albert Einstein 

We all familier with the power of compound


## [Rule of 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72)

**Useful to:** Predict how many iterations it takes to double an number in your head

__Example:__

Said your Ice Cream business revenue is 10K per month, if you want to doulbe your business next year, what is the monthly growth rate should be ?

it should be 72/12 = 6 , you need to grow 6 percent every month

How about grow your business by 8 times in a year ?

it should be 

72 * 3/12 = 18 , 18 percent every month
