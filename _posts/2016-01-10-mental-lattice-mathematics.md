Lattice Rank 1:

The first mental model Charlie Mungers Mentions, is Mathematics, why mathematics is ranked number 1 ? because it give you the ability to predict things, and it is true across the universe. 1 + 1 is always equal to 2.

How should you use this mental Model ? Mathematics is a great way to clear your mind.

Ways to use this mental Model:

* Set up math models of essential and quantifiable things you try to predict, for business , mostly is profitability & cash flow. Eg.

If you want to start a business and think it will work, laid down some number and your assumptions, try to calcualte the cash flow scenarios, try to calucate the profit level, varies your assumptions and throw some different [Monte Carlo Scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to see how your business hold up.

* Find out the key ratios of your business. eg rent to revenue ratio , gross margin etc, and scale your business revenue by scaling up or down 10 times, check the number and how it will hold up.  

## Size and Limits

**Useful to: to predict how physical object change when the size scale up or down.

How does weight, strength and surface area change when we change size?  


for example, a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube) of size 10cmx10cmx10cm, total circumference = 120 cm, area = 600, volume = 1000

for a cube of twice of the edge length, the 20cm x20cmx20cm,  total circumference = 240 cm, area = 2400, volume = 8000


For a cube , the math formula to calculate:

circumference = 12a 
surface area = 6 a^2\
volume = a^3\

so if cir double:

Cir = 12* (2a) = 24a
area = 6* (2a) * (2a)= 24 a^2
volume = (2a) * (2a) * (2a) = 8a^3

so if we double the edges of a cube:  

surface area will increase 4 times 
and volume will increase 8 times 

What is the signaficance of this ? The significance is for most real live object, weight or mass is often can be approximated by volume, and strengh can often approximated by surface area;

Peter Bevelin in his excellent book [Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Wisdom-Darwin-Munger-3rd/dp/1578644283/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452472859&sr=8-1&keywords=Seeking+Wisdom%3A+From+Darwin+To+Munger) gave a vivid example of this.

Imaging If you grow twice as tall, your will be weighting about 8 times as before, and your bone's cross section only incresae 4 times, so the stress to your bone is 2 times higher, and assumeing the material consist of your bone dont change, hence you are 50 % more fragile.

Ever Wonder Why the lagest animal in the sea is blue whale, which can reach 180 tons and the lagest land animal african elephant is only can reach about 7 tons ? 

Thats why.

## Compound Interest:

>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.”
>Albert Einstein 



## [Rule of 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72)

**Useful to:** Predict how many iterations it takes to double an number in your head

__Example:__

Said your Ice Cream business revenue is 10K per month, if you want to doulbe your business next year, what is the monthly growth rate should be ?

it should be 72/12 = 6 , you need to grow 6 percent every month

How about grow your business by 8 times in a year ?

it should be 

72 * 3/12 = 18 , 18 percent every month
