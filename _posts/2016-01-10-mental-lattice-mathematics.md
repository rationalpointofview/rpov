The first mental model Charlie Mungers Mentions, is Mathematics, why mathematics is ranked number 1 ? because it give you the ability to predict things, and it is true across the universe. 1 + 1 is always equal to 2.

How should you use this mental Model ? Mathematics is a great way to clear your mind.

If you want to start a business and think it will work, don't trust yourself, laid down some number and your assumptions, try to calcualte the cash flow scenarios, create different [Monte Carlo Scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

## Size and Limits ?

How does weight, strength and surface area change when we change size?  


for example, a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube) of size 10cmx10cmx10cm, total circumference = 120 cm, area = 600, volume = 1000

for a cube of twice of the edge length, the 20cm x20cmx20cm,  total circumference = 240 cm, area = 2400, volume = 8000


For a cube of edge length a:

cir = 12a 
area = 6 a^2\
volume = a^3\

so if cir double:

Cir = 12* (2R) = 24R
area = 6* (2R) * (2R)= 24 RR
volume = (2R) * (2R) * (2R) = 8RRR

so If we double the length or circumference  of a similarly shaped object, 

surface area increase 24 RR / 6 RR = 4 
and volume = 8 RRR/RRR= 8
