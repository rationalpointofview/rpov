**Mental Model Name:Invert** 
**Discipline:Mathematics** 
**Lattice Rank:3**

>"Invert, always invert" - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi

Many hard problems in live, can you easily resolve by transform the problem into inverse form.


****How to use this mental Model****:


(1) Invert.  Take a particular goal that you hope to achieve – now invert it to find your non-goal.  To do this ask: What don’t I want to achieve? For example, if your goal is to lose weight, then your non-goal is to get fat.

Once you have defined your non-goal, you are ready for step 2.

(2) Solve.  Step 2 is the analysis phase.  Here, we ask: What causes the non-goal?  In our example, the non-goal is getting fat.  Weight gain can be caused by: over-eating, lack of exercise, drinking too many calories, etc.  The object is to determine the primary factors that contribute to your non-goal.

(3) Re-invert.  Once you have your solution set, you re-invert by asking: How can I avoid that?  If the easiest way for you to achieve your non-goal is by overeating, then to improve your chances for losing weight, you need to focus on strategies that help you avoid overeating.



__Example__

The answer to the question "how to live a good life" is difficult, if not impossible.

But invert the questions, it becomes:

"how to guaranteed misery in life ?"

It becomes a lot easier to anwser,just as Charlie Munger demostrated in his famous [1986 Hardvard school speech](http://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/1986/06/13/charlie-mungers-speech-to-the-harvard-school-june-1986/) 


__Example__

Facebook IPOs now, Should you invest ?

Margin of safety give an excellent example of how Jay Ritter, Professor of Unviersity of Floriday use [inversion](http://amarginofsafety.com/2011/01/09/456/) to solve this question


__Example__

In this TED video, a Chess Grandmaster talks about his favourite technique of winner chess games, inversion

One of my favourite Technique to increase the successful ratio before starting out of project is doing [Pre-Mortem-Techniques](http://riskology.co/pre-mortem-technique/):

* Imaging your project/your new companys fails after one year from now

* Answer the questions, what caused the project/company to fail, list out the causes

* Provide antidote to those causes.
