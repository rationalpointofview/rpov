**Mental Model Name:elementary math of permutations and combinations**
**Discipline:Mathematics  ** 
**Lattice Rank:4 **

>Elementary math of permutations and combinations, It's very simple algebra. It was all worked out in the course of about one year between Pascal and Fermat. They worked it out casually in a series of letters.

>It's not that hard to learn. What is hard is to get so you use it routinely almost everyday of your life. The Fermat/Pascal system is dramatically consonant with the way that the world works. And it's fundamental truth. So you simply have to have the technique.
