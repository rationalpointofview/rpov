Mathematically, Bayes' theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of A and B, P(A) and P(B), and the conditional probabilities of A given B and B given A, P(A|B) and P(B|A). In its most common form, it is:

![Bayes Theorem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/c/d3c7c452b3d01f5415dd9bf15d2ab822.png)

whats the relationship of A to B ?

p (A|B) read: probability of A happens given B is true
note, P(B) is the overal probability of event B happens


A is the intrinsic fact, and  B is merely a test and will not change the probability of A happening,

you can imaging A is a elephant, and B is an blind observer and try to determine what is he touching.

note, the event A is not going to interference B, mainly an observer event, use decision tree to understand this.

This Theorem is better understand from an example.


**How to use this mental Model**:

Use it to understand the true implications of test results:


**Conditions:**

The Event A is statistical event.

The Event B is a test;


**Predictions:**

Give the outcome of P(A) is true give B is true:


**Examples**

Concrete example from [5 August 2011 New York Times article by John Allen Paulos](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=0):
"Assume that youâ€™re presented with three coins, two of them fair and the other a counterfeit that always lands heads. If you randomly pick one of the three coins,
