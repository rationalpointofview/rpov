**Mental Model Name:Bayes's Theorem** 
**Discipline:Mathematics** 
**Lattice Rank :6**

Introductions

Mathematically, Bayes' theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of A and B, P(A) and P(B), and the conditional probabilities of A given B and B given A, P(A|B) and P(B|A). In its most common form, it is:

![Bayes Theorem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/c/d3c7c452b3d01f5415dd9bf15d2ab822.png)

whats the relationship of A to B ?

p (A|B) read: probability of A happens given B is true
note, P(B) is the overal probability of event B happens


A is the intrinsic fact, and  B is merely a test and will not change the probability or outcome of A,

you can imaging A is a elephant, and B is an blind observer and try to use his hand to touch the elephant.

note, the event A is not going to interference B, mainly an observer event, use decision tree to understand this
