from [cas$hvertising](www.amazon.com)

Human beings are biologically programmed with the following eight desires:

* Sexual companionship.
* To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses
* Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.
* Enjoyment of food and beverages.
* Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.

even know that someone else satisfy the LF8 will bring you gratification

to use LF8,

By using language that’s both specific and visual, I was able to install a mental movie inside your head.


**Examples**:

When it came to making big money selling books, mail order guru Haldeman-Julius wrote the book. During the 1920s and ’30s he sold more than 200 million of them, in nearly 2,000 different titles. They were simple little books, and they all cost just 5 cents each. To advertise his books, he placed ads consisting of only the books’ titles. If a book didn’t sell well, he’d change the ad copy, but not the way you’d expect. He actually changed the titles of the books! Then he’d sit back and study the response. How clever.

![Look what happened when the titles were changed based on the LF8.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/34jzi8di.png)

* Use the incentive as a goal and try to predict how can someone maximum the incentive under the system

    - learn and use the basic elements of your advisor's trade as you deal with the advisor
    - double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you're told , to the degree that seems approciate after objective thoughts
    - Crosscheck with numbers and predictions
    - Tough internal audit systems
    - Misbehaviour-preventing routings and such machines as cash registers

Too Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff

By Erin Arvedlund

What common denominator was there between all the people who suspected Medoff had problems but looked the other way? Shared greed is the natural first answer. Police investigating a mine always ask, "Who benefits from the crime?" Makin, Noel, Piedrahita, Masoke, Schulman, and others all shared a common intere,st. They all stood to lose a lot if they looked too closely and found something about Medoff that was mis convienent.

In Too Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff

By Erin Arvedlund

>It gives out an insight why so many successful—and, therefore, supposedly intelligent—people were so susceptible to Medoff s duplicity. "There were many seasoned market professionals, whom one would otherwise describe as intelligent and rational, who were taken in," said Christopher Miller of Allenbridge Hedgelnfo.

"Some of them may have thought they understood the split-strike strategy, but no one else was doing anything similar they could compare with So instead of concentrating on the red flags, we looked for masons why such people could be duped."

> Double avoidance tendency

He came up with a few groups. The first was compfised of Investors who did due diligence, knew that there were concerns surrounding Medoff, and so allocated only a relatively small percentage with the firm. For them, it was worth the risk if they could get the returns. "Those people have a high level of tolerance for things they don't understand, or for being lied to," Miller said.

Another group were investors who did due diligence, knew that there mere questions, but since Medoff had been running so long, was known to give money back instantly, and was so well regarded, they figured such allegations must he baseless.

> social prove,

“These people have found the red flags, but then they start looking for reasons to ignore them. They want a money manager who is a profit-seeking type."

Then there were investors who knew someone else had done due diligence and invested but who didn't know the concerns. "These people were cheapskates. It's all right to use a third party to do due diligence, but they invested even though they had not read the reports." This group includes investors through feeder funds, who did no due diligence because they were sold investments by regulated firms audited by big-name auditors who hadn't asked enough questions.

> Incentive tendency

Fairfield Greenwich, for one, shopped for three separate auditors over a period of three years. Auditors accepted the documentation they were given and the opinions from the tiny auditor that Medoff used "This is not just a hedge fund issue, this is a global auditing issue. There is no suggestion that big-name auditors did anything illegal," Miller said, but perhaps their terms of reference need to be looked at.

What common denominator was there between all the people who suspected Medoff had problems but looked the other way? Shared greed is the natural first answer. Police investigating a mine always ask, "Who benefits from the crime?" Makin, Noel, Piedrahita, Masoke, Schulman, and others all shared a common intere,st. They all stood to lose a lot if they looked too closely and found something about Medoff that was mis convienent.

Examples

Fact: No matter how often you wash your sheets, your bed is an insect breeding ground, teeming with thousands of hideous, crab-like dust mites aggressively laying eggs in your pillow and mattress, causing you and your family to suffer year-long allergy attacks. While you sleep, they actually wake up and start to crawl, eat your skin flakes, and drink the moisture on your flesh. It gets worse. Did you know that 10 percent of the weight of a two-year-old pillow is actually dead mites and their feces?
