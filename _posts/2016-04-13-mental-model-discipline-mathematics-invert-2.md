**Mental Model Name:Invert** **Discipline:Mathematics** **Lattice Rank:3**

> "Invert, always invert" - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi

Many hard problems in live, can you easily resolve by transform the problem into inverse form.

**How to use this mental Model**:

(1) Invert. Take a particular goal that you hope to achieve – now invert it to find your non-goal. To do this ask: What don’t I want to achieve? For example, if your goal is to lose weight, then your non-goal is to get fat.

Once you have defined your non-goal, you are ready for step 2.

(2) Solve. Step 2 is the analysis phase. Here, we ask: What causes the non-goal? In our example, the non-goal is getting fat. Weight gain can be caused by: over-eating, lack of exercise, drinking too many calories, etc. The object is to determine the primary factors that contribute to your non-goal.

(3) Re-invert. Once you have your solution set, you re-invert by asking: How can I avoid that? If the easiest way for you to achieve your non-goal is by overeating, then to improve your chances for losing weight, you need to focus on strategies that help you avoid overeating.

**Example**

The answer to the question "how to live a good life" is difficult, if not impossible.

But invert the questions, it becomes:

"how to guaranteed misery in life ?"

It becomes a lot easier to anwser,just as Charlie Munger demostrated in his famous [1986 Hardvard school speech][1]

**[Example, From Charlie Munger](http://www.hikingat45degrees.com/a-conversation-with-charlie-munger/)**

>I gave problems to my children and once when I had all of the them together, I said, “Well there’s an activity in America. There’s a one-on-one tournament. And the national champion became the national champion on two separate occasions 65 years apart. Name the activity.” And seven of my children could not remotely do it. The eighths is a PhD physicist and he did it very quickly. And what he did was just turned it around. He says, can it be athletic? And he realized, no, no eighty-five year old was ever going to win an athletic thing with the neurological or other deteriorations that are so evident tonight on the stage. And so he says, could it be chess? Is he a chess player? And he realized that no eighty-five year old was ever going to be the US chess champion. He knows what a chess tournament is like. But that led him to checkers, a game that you could almost master with enough experience. And of course, that was the correct answer. It took him about 15 seconds. All kinds of problems like that that look so difficult, if you turn them around they are quickly solved. And so this process that I’ve gone through life doing, by identifying folly and trying to avoid it has worked wonderfully for me.


**Example**

Facebook IPOs now, Should you invest ?

Margin of safety give an excellent example of how Jay Ritter, Professor of Unviersity of Floriday use [inversion][2] to solve this question

**Example**

[In this TED video][3], a Chess Grandmaster talks about his favourite technique of winner chess games, inversion

**Example**

One of my favourite Technique to increase the successful ratio before starting out of project is doing [Pre-Mortem-Techniques][4]:

*   Imaging your project/your new companys fails after one year from now

*   Answer the questions, what caused the project/company to fail, list out the causes

*   Provide antidote to those causes.
