**Lattice Rank: 2** 
**Discipline: Mathematics** 
**Mental Model Name: Size and Limits**

Is that any physical things in the things your try to predict ? if so, this model will help you predict how it will behave when scalling;

**How to use this mental Model**:

Useful to: to predict how physical object property change when the size scale up or down.

**Mental short cuts/Simulation:**

Assuming the object is uniform and make of same material,

Weight = A * Volume, and Volume is 3D thing

Strength = B * Cross Section Area, Cross Section Area is a 2D thing

Edge/length, is one D thing;

Surface Area/Weight = C/ Length

A ,B C is some constant



Calculation and formular is [here][1]:

****Predictions****:

*   When Object made of the same material scale up in size( Become Larger):
    
    The Rate of increase of Volume is the fastest ( becuase it is 3D)
    
        - Weight/mass object will increase faster than cross section area, hence the object will become more fragile
        
        - Weight/mass of the object will increase after than the total surface area 
        

*   When Object made of the same material scale down in size( Become smaller):
    
        - Weight/mass object will increase **slower** than cross section area, hence the object will become more stronger, reference to its own weight
        
        - Weight/mass of the object will increase **slower** after than the total surface area

**Example**

How does weight, strength and surface area change when we change size?

Peter Bevelin in his excellent book [Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition][2] gave a vivid example of this.

Imaging If you grow twice as tall, your will be weighting about 8 times as before, and your bone's cross section only incresae 4 times, so the stress to your bone is 2 times higher, and assumeing the material consist of your bone dont change, hence you are 50 % more fragile.

Ever Wonder Why the lagest animal in the sea is blue whale, which can reach 180 tons and the lagest land animal african elephant is only can reach about 7 tons ?

Thats why.

![10 x shorter](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/ybo_pmqb.png)

**If you are 10x shorter:**

Your length is 1D thing, 10X shorter
Your weight is a 3D thing, will be 1000 times lighter
Your strengh,which propostional to bone cross section area, will be 100 times weaker   

But your Weight/Strength ratio will be 10 times better,

**If you are 10x taller:**

Your length is 1D thing, 10X longer
Your weight is a 3D thing, will be 1000 times heavier
Your strengh,which propostional to bone cross section area, will be 100 times stronger   
But your Weight/Strength ratio will be 10 times weaker, and likely collapse from your own weight

**Example**

Dust Explosion:

![flour explosion](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/hap77nc1.png)

A lot of things will become flammable or even will [explode][3] when reduce in size.

why ?

Because burning is basically a chemical reaction, and needs oxygen from the air. 

For Example:

When a ball of flour(say 10cm in diameter ) is grounded to powder form(say each powder is 0.1 mm in diameter):

The diameter of the blour ball is reduced by 1000 times

but the Surface Area/Weight Ratio is increased by 1000 times, thus each flour particle is getting 1000 times more oxygen.

thats why.

Wonder what will burn in an increased oxygen contration enviroment ?

[![iron burn in oxygen](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/hceu163c.png)](https://youtu.be/TkE1uVjrY0w)

**Example**

Ever Wonder Why the ancient bugs you saw is so large ?

One [leading theory][4] is because of size and limit:

it turn out because of on the ancient earth, the oxygen level is much higher. about 30% of the total area volume, and about 50% higher than now.

and turn out insect larvae typically absorb oxygen directly through their skin, and they have little or no control over exactly how much of the oxygen they take it.

While crucial to life, oxygen can be poisonous in large quantitie;

so in order to maintain oxygen level to the same level, they grow larger to lower Volume/Total surface area ratio to keep the oxygen in take in relative to body

**Example**

Which one is more complex ? Stars or an ant ?

JohnBribbin in [Deep simplicity][5] mentions, stars by nature is very simple.

Why ? because at the scale of the stars, the gravity alone will crush any structures within the stars and make it reduce to atoms only, and life is the most complex things in universe, exactly because of it can hold and made of different structures.
