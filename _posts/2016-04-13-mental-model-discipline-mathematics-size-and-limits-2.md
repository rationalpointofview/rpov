**Lattice Rank: 2** 
**Discipline: Mathematics** 
**Mental Model Name: Size and Limits**

Is that any physical things in the things your try to predict ? if so, this model will help you predict how it will behave when scaling;

**How to use this mental Model**:

Useful to: to predict how physical object property change when the size scale up or down.

**Mental short cuts/Simulation:**
       
Assuming the object is uniform and make of same material,

Weight = A * Volume, and Volume is 3D thing

Strength = B * Cross Section Area, Cross Section Area is a 2D thing

Edge/length, is one D thing;

Surface Area/Weight = C/ Length

A ,B C is some constant



Calculation and formular is [here][1]:

**Predictions**:

*   When Object made of the same material scale up in size( Become Larger):
    
  - The Rate of increase of Volume(Hence the Weight) is the fastest ( becuase it is 3D)
    
  - Weight/mass object will increase faster than cross section area(ie. strength), the object will become more fragile
        
       

*   When Object made of the same material scale down in size( Become smaller):
    
  - Weight/mass object will decrease faster than cross section area(strengh), hence the object will become stronger, reference to its own weight
        
    
        




**Example**

How does weight, strength and surface area change when we change size?

Peter Bevelin in his excellent book [Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition][2] gave a vivid example of this.

Imaging If you grow twice as tall, your will be weighting about 8 times as before, and your bone's cross section only incresae 4 times, so the stress to your bone is 2 times higher, and assumeing the material consist of your bone dont change, hence you are 50 % more fragile.

Ever Wonder Why the lagest animal in the sea is blue whale, which can reach 180 tons and the lagest land animal african elephant is only can reach about 7 tons ?

Thats why.

![10 x shorter](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/ybo_pmqb.png)

**If you are 10x shorter:**

Your length is 1D thing, 10X shorter
Your weight is a 3D thing, will be 1000 times lighter
Your strengh,which propostional to bone cross section area, will be 100 times weaker   

But your Weight/Strength ratio will be 10 times better,

**If you are 10x taller:**

Your length is 1D thing, 10X longer
Your weight is a 3D thing, will be 1000 times heavier
Your strengh,which propostional to bone cross section area, will be 100 times stronger   
But your Weight/Strength ratio will be 10 times weaker, and likely collapse from your own weight

**Example**

Dust Explosion:

![flour explosion](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/hap77nc1.png)

A lot of things will become flammable or even will [explode][3] when reduce in size.

why ?

Because burning is basically a chemical reaction, and needs oxygen from the air. 

For Example:

When a ball of flour(say 10cm in diameter ) is grounded to powder form(say each powder is 0.1 mm in diameter):

The diameter of the blour ball is reduced by 1000 times

but the Surface Area/Weight Ratio is increased by 1000 times, thus each flour particle is getting 1000 times more oxygen.

thats why.

Wonder what will burn in an increased oxygen contration enviroment ?

[![iron burn in oxygen](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/hceu163c.png)](https://youtu.be/TkE1uVjrY0w)

**Example big bugs? **

Ever Wonder Why the ancient bugs you saw is so large ?

One [leading theory][4] is because of size and limit:

it turn out because of on the ancient earth, the oxygen level is much higher. about 30% of the total area volume, and about 50% higher than now.

and turn out insect larvae typically absorb oxygen directly through their skin, and they have little or no control over exactly how much of the oxygen they take it.

While crucial to life, oxygen can be poisonous in large quantitie;

so in order to maintain oxygen level to the same level, they grow larger to lower Volume/Total surface area ratio to keep the oxygen in take in relative to body

**Example stars and Ant**

Which one is more complex ? Stars or an ant ?

JohnBribbin in [Deep simplicity][5] mentions, stars by nature is very simple.

Why ? because at the scale of the stars, the gravity alone will crush any structures within the stars and make it reduce to atoms only, and life is the most complex things in universe, exactly because of it can hold and made of different structures.

**Example You can't have more than 150 friends**

>Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person

According to Dunbar's research, it is limited to 150.

Why is there a limit for your friends ?

Thats because to truely know a friend, basically you need to manage other people's mind states, which cost a great deal of neurons in your brain.

> Robin Dunbar: Well, it has a lot of implications for organizations I suspect. The classic case of this would be the military. So all modern armies are structured along these lines, so this sort of layer of 150 general friends that you have, turns out to consist of a series of layers which are scaled very tightly with respect to each other: so each layer is three times bigger than the other; so you have an inner, inner core of intimate friends and relations, of about five, and then there’s the next layer out, it’s about 15. If you like to think of those as best friends, perhaps, they’re the people you might do most of your social Saturday evening barbeques with, and that of course, includes the five inside. And then this next layer out is 50 (you might think of those as good friends), and the 150, your friends. And then we know there are at least two more layers beyond that: one at 500 which you might think of as acquaintances, so again this is including everybody within the 150 as well; , finally, one at 1500 who are basically the number of faces you can put names to. But you see those numbers absolutely replicated beautifully across modern armies: that’s how they’re all structured, and they just carry on with the next series out, so 5000, 15000, 50000. So there seems to be something that works particularly effectively in terms of organization at these kind of numbers. Remember, these layers are about the intensity of the relationship, so we would think about that in terms of emotional closeness, but it probably has a lot to do with how well you understand how the other person ticks.

>And therefore, if you want to have an organizational unit that involves very, very close working together, you cannot do it with a group of 150: you may have to have 15, because that’s the limit, at that level of intimacy, that people can work together. So you might think of all sorts of knock-­on consequences, that instead of having schools of about 1500, as we do at the moment, perhaps they should be 150, and then they would be much more intimate.
