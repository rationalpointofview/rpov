Lattice Rank 1: Displine: Mathematics

The first mental model Charlie Mungers Mentions, is Mathematics, why mathematics is ranked number 1 ? because it give you the ability to predict things, and it is true across the universe. 1 + 1 is always equal to 2.

How should you use this mental Model ?

**How to use this mental Model**:

**Use basic arithmetic to clear your mind.**

The most useful tools in math is +-x/ : , but numbers doesn't make much sense alone, you need to make it move and scale to buidl a mental model.

*   Identify critical path you try to analyse;
    
    * List Input/outputs
    
    eg. for a business it is quite simple, cash flow and profit;

*   laydown a spreadsheet, try to predict:
   
    * the scenarios 12 months later.
    
    * the input x 10 times, what happen to inputs and the system, will it break ? 
    * the output x 10 times, what does it take for inputs, will it break ?
    
    For example;
    
    If you want to start a business and think it will work, create a spreadsheet, laid down some number and your assumptions;
    
        * calcualte the cash flow scenarios, 
        * calucate the profit level, varies your assumptions and throw some different [Monte Carlo Scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to see how your business hold up.
        * Find out the key ratios of your business. eg rent to revenue ratio , gross margin etc, and scale your business revenue by scaling up or down 10 times, check the number and how it will hold up.  
        

One Mental Model or short cut you will find it useful is:


## [Rule of 72][1]

**Useful to:** Predict how many iterations it takes to double an number in your head

**Example:**

Said your Ice Cream business revenue is 10K per month, if you want to doulbe your business next year, what is the monthly growth rate should be ?

it should be 72/12 = 6 , you need to grow 6 percent every month

How about grow your business by 8 times in a year ?

it should be

72 * 3/12 = 18 , 18 percent every month


The signature of Compound Interest occuring is the famous hocky stick diagram:
