Lattice Rank 1: Displine: Mathematics

The first mental model Charlie Mungers Mentions, is Mathematics, why mathematics is ranked number 1 ? because it give you the ability to predict things, and it is true across the universe. 1 + 1 is always equal to 2.

How should you use this mental Model ?

****How to use this mental Model****:

**Use basic arithmetic to clear your mind.**

*   Identify the measurements of results you are trying to achieve;
    
    eg. for a business it is quite simple, cash flow and profit;

*   laydown a spreadsheet, try to predict the scenarios 12 months later.
    
    For example;
    
    If you want to start a business and think it will work, create a spreadsheet, laid down some number and your assumptions;
    
        * calcualte the cash flow scenarios, 
        * calucate the profit level, varies your assumptions and throw some different [Monte Carlo Scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to see how your business hold up.
        * Find out the key ratios of your business. eg rent to revenue ratio , gross margin etc, and scale your business revenue by scaling up or down 10 times, check the number and how it will hold up.  
        

One Mental Model or short cut you will find it useful is:

## Compound Interest:

> “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.” Albert Einstein

## [Rule of 72][1]

**Useful to:** Predict how many iterations it takes to double an number in your head

**Example:**

Said your Ice Cream business revenue is 10K per month, if you want to doulbe your business next year, what is the monthly growth rate should be ?

it should be 72/12 = 6 , you need to grow 6 percent every month

How about grow your business by 8 times in a year ?

it should be

72 * 3/12 = 18 , 18 percent every month

**Example:**

We all well aware of the power of compounding, in money terms. But arguably, the most important asset to most people is not money or possessions, it is yourself.

How hard is that you increase your value to others by studying/creating good habits/acquire new skill by merely just 1% ?

If you can do that every single day, how long will it take for your to double your income ?

Just as James Altucher stated in his [one percent rule][2]

use Rule of 72, you will quickly find out, just 72 days!

**Example**

Why do Stock market out perform bonds ?

[In Warrent Buffett on the stock markets][3], Warren Buffet explains why stock market out performs bonds by attributing to compound interest.

> To report what Edgar Lawrence Smith discovered, I will quote a legendary thinker--John Maynard Keynes, who in 1925 reviewed the book, thereby putting it on the map. In his review, Keynes described "perhaps Mr. Smith's most important point ... and certainly his most novel point. Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back in the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest (Keynes' italics) operating in favor of a sound industrial investment."
> 
> It was that simple. It wasn't even news. People certainly knew that companies were not paying out 100% of their earnings. But investors hadn't thought through the implications of the point. Here, though, was this guy Smith saying, "Why do stocks typically outperform bonds? A major reason is that businesses retain earnings, with these going on to generate still more earnings--and dividends, too."

That finding ignited an unprecedented bull market. Galvanized by Smith's insight, investors piled into stocks, anticipating a double dip: their higher initial yield over bonds, and growth to boot. For the American public, this new understanding was like the discovery of fire.
