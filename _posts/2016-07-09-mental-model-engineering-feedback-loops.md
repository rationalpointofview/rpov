Introductions

What defines a feedback loop ? Basically it takes the system output and feedback to its input

The powerful thing about feedback system is we can treat the system as blackbox and control the output, wihtout adjust it from the inside.

There are two types of Feedback system:

* Positive Feedback:

    >Positive feedback has the property that signals tend to reinforce themselves, and grow larger through compound interest;

    Positive Feedback is quite useless in engineering and we try to eliminate it by all means, mainly because it will make the system unstable and quite uncontrollable.

    But in real life, positive feedback loop impact your life in a much bigger way than negative feedback, as by leveraging compound interest, it can create spectacular events.

    As an example of a positive feedback system, consider an audio amplification system with a speaker and a microphone. 

    Examples of Positive Feedback in daily life:

    Economic: Housing Bubbles

    Bank Runs:

    George Soros in [The Alchemy of Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Finance-George-Soros/dp/0471445495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468051982&sr=8-1&keywords=soros+alchemy) mentions about theory reflexivity, once market is trapped in reflexivity, the market trend became certain. Certain means the output is predictable.

    The attribution of theory of reflexivity could be just positive feedback:

    the output of rising stock price/currency prices feedback to the input, the general publics psychology, generate the desire to chase profit -> buy the uptrend-> rising stock price/currency prices, it creates the positive feedback loop and will go on and on, until all the avaliable money was draw in, then the reaction will stop, and burble burst -> price fall

    you got the idea.

    John Gribbin in [Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity] argues Chaos, could be just positive feedback + uncertain initial starting position;


    [Steven Strogatz, professor of theoretical and applied mechanics at Cornell University, describes the Millennium Bridge's notorious opening-day oscillations in the Nov. 3 issue of Nature.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051103080801.htm)    

    [![milliennem bridge](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/fk1d35p0.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAXVa__XWZ8)

    > The Millennium Bridge, a 320-meter-long lateral suspension bridge connecting London's financial district to Bankside, south of the river, opened June 10, 2000. Thousands of pedestrians streamed over it.

    >At first, the bridge was still. Then it began to sway, just slightly.

    > Then, almost from one moment to the next, the wobble intensified. And suddenly, people were walking like tentative ice skaters: planting their feet wide, pushing out to the side with each step. Left, right, left, right, in near-perfect unison.
    
    > Instead of focusing on the structure, Strogatz examines the strange phenomenon of people unknowingly working together, simply by walking.

    > The military has known for years that troops marching in step can create enough vertical force to destroy a bridge. It is standard practice for soldiers to break step at every bridge crossing.

    > But the Millennium Bridge problem is not quite the same, says Strogatz. In this case, the movement was lateral, not vertical. More importantly, the people were just pedestrians. No one was trying to walk in step; pedestrians did so only to accommodate the bridge's movement under their feet. 
     
     That's a live demostration of positive feedbackloop. people were walking disorganized and random, but once a few of them got into sync by pure chance, the wobbling becomes marked enough to lead more and more people to snap into its freqenency and compounding wobbling.

     > And the critical number of pedestrians, tested subsequently on the Millennium Bridge and derived independently by Strogatz and co-authors, is as low as 160. An estimated 80,000 people crossed the bridge on opening day, with as many as 2,000 on it at any one time.
     


    
* Negative Feedback:

    > We subtract the value of the output from the value of the input (our desired value), we get a value called the error signal. The error signal shows us how far off our output is from our desired input.

Negative Feedback system will make the system output stable:

for example:

cruise control works by measures your speed by looking at the speedometer, and then adjust the throttle to either accelerate or decelerate to bring the speed to the desired number. 


**How to use this mental Model**:

* Find out the system input and output.

    * Beware if human is involved in the system, as human is suspectiable to [social prove](http://www.rationalpov.com/mental-model-s2-human-psychology-bias-2/), and it often creates positive feedback loop by itself.

* Increase/decrease output by 10x, and try to analyse how it will influcence the input.

**Predictions:**

* Positive Feedbackloop
    * the output will grow in compound interest.
    * the output will decline sharply after the peak

* Negative Feedbackloop
    * the output will be stable.
