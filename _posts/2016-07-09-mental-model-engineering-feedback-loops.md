Introductions

What defines a feedback loop ? Basically it takes the system output and feedback to its input

The powerful thing about feedback system is we can treat the system as blackbox and control the output, wihtout adjust it from the inside.

There are two types of Feedback system:

* Positive Feedback:

    >Positive feedback has the property that signals tend to reinforce themselves, and grow larger. 

    As an example of a positive feedback system, consider an audio amplification system with a speaker and a microphone. 

    Positive Feedback is quite useless in engineering and we try to eliminate it by all means, mainly because it will make the system unstable and quite uncontrollable.

    But in real life, positive feedback loop impact your life in a much bigger way than negative feedback;

    Examples of Positive Feedback in daily life:

    Economic: Housing Bubbles, or any kind of bubles:

    George Soros in [The Alchemy of Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Finance-George-Soros/dp/0471445495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468051982&sr=8-1&keywords=soros+alchemy) mentions about theory reflexivity, once market is trapped in reflexivity, the market trend became certain.

    The attribution of theory of reflexivity could be just positive feedback:

    the output of rising stock price/currency prices feedback to the input, the general publics psychology, generate the desire to chase profit -> buy the uptrend-> rising stock price/currency prices. 

    you got the idea.

    John Gribbin in [Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity] argues Chaos, could be just positive feedback + uncertain initial starting position;






* Negative Feedback:

    > We subtract the value of the output from the value of the input (our desired value), we get a value called the error signal. The error signal shows us how far off our output is from our desired input.

Negative Feedback system will make the system output stable:

for example:

cruise control works by measures your speed by looking at the speedometer, and then adjust the throttle to either accelerate or decelerate to bring the speed to the desired number.
