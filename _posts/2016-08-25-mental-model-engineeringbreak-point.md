**Mental Model Name: Break Point** 
**Discipline: Engineering** 
**Related Lattice**:

*   Upstream:Mathematics, basic arithmetic

*   Downstream:

# Introductions

> In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. - wiki

[Farnam Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/) give a very good explaination of the nature of break point -- Multiplicative System.

> What’s 1,506,789 x 9,809 x 5.56 x 0?

> Hopefully you didn’t have to whip out the old TI-84 to solve that one. It’s a zero.

and that zero, is our concept of break points.

> “Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don’t have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; it’s true. If you hire somebody without [integrity], you really want them to be dumb and lazy.” - Warrent Buffet 

Integrity is the 0 and the break points here

* [ExampleL Pilot light](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4c2te0/what_is_a_breakpoint/)
> I took a course on materials and a speaker came to talk about his line of work consisting of analyzing failures. He spoke of a manufacturing plant of a certain flammable gas and they have pilot lights all around the plant, so if a gas leak gets large enough one of the pilot lights will ignite the gas cloud and explode. The pilot lights aren't there for IF a gas leak happens,it's there for WHEN it does. The fail safe is a pilot light, without it the gas cloud would get so dense and large that it would be catastrophic otherwise.
