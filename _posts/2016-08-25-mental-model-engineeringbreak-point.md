**Mental Model Name: Break Point** 
**Discipline: Engineering** 
**Related Lattice**:

*   Upstream:Mathematics, basic arithmetic

*   Downstream:

# Introductions

> A fuse interrupts an excessive current so that further damage by overheating or fire is prevented - wikipedia.

> In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. - wiki


> “Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don’t have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; it’s true. If you hire somebody without [integrity], you really want them to be dumb and lazy.” - Warrent Buffet 

[Farnam Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/) give a very good explaination of the nature of break point -- Multiplicative System.

> What’s 1,506,789 x 9,809 x 5.56 x 0?

> Hopefully you didn’t have to whip out the old TI-84 to solve that one. It’s a zero.

and that zero, is our concept of break points.


the Upstream of this lattice is Basic Arithmetics:

[Farnma Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-multiplicative-systems/) argues there are two type of system:

* Multiplicative System. the system is a multiple system, and each stage of the system process is a multiplication and thus the system output is govern by the weakest link, or the break points.

System Ouput = Stage1 x Stage 2 x Stage 3 ...

It is the Fragile System of Nassim Taleb descripted in his book [Anti Fragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680)

Some Example he has given: 

> Salaried employment: while it looks safe on the surface (predictable salary every month) it is subject to the catastrophic risk of losing one's job.

> Debt-fueled economies: debt has no flexibility, so these economies can't stand even a slowdown without risking implosion (cf current situation)



* Additive System. 

System Output = Stage 1 + Stage 2 + Stage 3 ...

The Nassim Tableb's term for Additive System is robust or even better, **Anti Fragile**

# How to use this mental Model:

## Conditions:

The system is multiplicative system

## Predictions:

The System output is govern by its breakpoint, thus simplies the system


## Examples:

___
* [ExampleL Pilot light](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4c2te0/what_is_a_breakpoint/)
> I took a course on materials and a speaker came to talk about his line of work consisting of analyzing failures. He spoke of a manufacturing plant of a certain flammable gas and they have pilot lights all around the plant, so if a gas leak gets large enough one of the pilot lights will ignite the gas cloud and explode. The pilot lights aren't there for IF a gas leak happens,it's there for WHEN it does. The fail safe is a pilot light, without it the gas cloud would get so dense and large that it would be catastrophic otherwise.
