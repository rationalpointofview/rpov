Introductions

> “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.” Albert Einstein

We all well aware of the power of compounding, in money terms. But arguably, the most important asset to most people is not your car, not your house, not even your bank accout. it is you.

How hard is that you increase your value to others by studying/creating good habits/acquire new skill by merely just 1% ?

If you can do that every single day, how long will it take for your to double your income ?

> "I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you." - Charlie Munger USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007


Just as [James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/) stated in his [one percent rule][2]

> Improve a little each day. It compounds. When 1% compounds every day, it doubles every 72 days, not every 100 days. Compounding tiny excellence is what creates big excellence.

To me, thats the essense of the compound interest, compound yourself.


**How to use this mental Model**:

Identify your compounding base. 

* What do you want to compound ? 

* Is that compoundable ? 


    Compounding usually take time and effort, make sure your are not try to compound a sand castle

    ![sand castle](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/8a95omz6xkznrmw/rdax53s3.png)

* When does it compound ? by time or turn ?


    Thats the secret of all the business. business compounds not with time, but when a transaction happens. 

    [High frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) is a very good example of that. 

    ![ cents](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Assorted_United_States_coins.jpg)

    HFTs earn only a tiny profits per trade, but with a lot of trades per day, the profit quickly compounds.




**Conditions:**

A base that can be compound.

**Predictions:**

You can use law of 72 to calculate how fast it can grown. 

The signature of Compound Interest occuring is the famous hocky stick diagram:

**Example**

Why do Stock market out perform bonds ?

[In Warrent Buffett on the stock markets][3], Warren Buffet explains why stock market out performs bonds by attributing to compound interest.

> To report what Edgar Lawrence Smith discovered, I will quote a legendary thinker--John Maynard Keynes, who in 1925 reviewed the book, thereby putting it on the map. In his review, Keynes described "perhaps Mr. Smith's most important point ... and certainly his most novel point. Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back in the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest (Keynes' italics) operating in favor of a sound industrial investment."
> 
> It was that simple. It wasn't even news. People certainly knew that companies were not paying out 100% of their earnings. But investors hadn't thought through the implications of the point. Here, though, was this guy Smith saying, "Why do stocks typically outperform bonds? A major reason is that businesses retain earnings, with these going on to generate still more earnings--and dividends, too."

That finding ignited an unprecedented bull market. Galvanized by Smith's insight, investors piled into stocks, anticipating a double dip: their higher initial yield over bonds, and growth to boot. For the American public, this new understanding was like the discovery of fire.
