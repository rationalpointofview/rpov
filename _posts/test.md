**Mental Model Name:Central Limit Theorem**
**Discipline:Mathematics** 
**Lattice Rank :7**

#Introductions

The central limit theorom tells you that, if you draw a fix number of samples n ( assume it is big enough ) random samples from a pool, then the sum of these sample values will form a bell curve, which mean of the sum will be true mean x n, and standard deviation of these sum will be pool standard deviation * n^1/2

for example, if you flip a coin 100 times, and said assign a value to head as 1 , and tail as 0, and do the 100 times flip say 1000 times, when you plot a histogram of the sum of coin flip, you will see a bell curve ,

which bell curve mean will be around 50, and the standard deviation will be 0.5 *(100)^0.5, which is 5
